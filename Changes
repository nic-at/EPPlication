      this approach keeps the memory footprint small enough
      even for arbritary sized tests and scales much better.
    - instant run of tests is not done in Catalyst process anymore.
      instead the job daemon takes care of that.
      jobs can be of type 'test' and 'temp'
    - normalize DB schema, new table step_results
      no longer store JSON serialized results in job.data

0.8.0  17/12/2013
    - fill in form with default variable names

      parameter aswell 'input' which is expected to be a serialized
      JSON string.

      only have a name, password and a couple of roles (permissions).
    - In order to decouple DBICs copy from EPPlications copy we always use
      the 'verb' clone from now on. The reason behind this change is that we now
